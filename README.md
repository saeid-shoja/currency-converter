### `how to use app`: 

1- if you are a new user, then in the first step you will see a page that can choose your default currency to see its rate against 'UST' and 'EUR' on the Current Rate page.

2- the default currency will save in your local storage and it will be there for the next time that you use the app

3- you can change your default currency using a link on the Current Rate page.

4- in the app, we have a navigation bar for navigating between our pages: a: current page that has been said about that above. b: converter page: in this page, you have two inputs and two select inputs to choose currencies and enter their amount and it will calculate and convert it automatically
